### Hi, I'm Helen 👋🏻

As a career-changer into data engineering, I see coding as a chance to combine my love of problem solving, language learning, and organisation.

I recently completed an intensive, industry-led bootcamp with Northcoders, where I learned to work with a range of programming langauges—JavaScript, Python, SQL and more—gaining hands-on experience in data cleaning, transformation and visualisation.
All of the projects I completed can be found through this GitHub profile; our final project, where we built an ETL pipeline using CI/CD and Agile methodologies, can be found [here](https://github.com/CavemanDan667/de-project).

🌱 What I'm currently working on:
* building interactive projects with React and displaying data with d3
* studying for the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level
